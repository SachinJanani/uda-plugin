UDA, a software plugin, accelerates Hadoop network and improves the scaling of Hadoop clusters executing data analytic intensive applications.
A novel data moving protocol which uses RDMA in combination with an efficient merge-sort algorithm enables Hadoop clusters based on InfiniBand and
10GbE and 40GbE RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) adapter cards to efficiently
move data between servers accelerating the Hadoop framework.
UDA is based on a collaborative development of Auburn University and Mellanox.
